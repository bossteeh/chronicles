    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Our Story - From Tolulope’s view <br>
      Do you believe in Love at First Sight? That was what I felt the first time I saw her. I was part of the committee that organized a Pastor’s Seed Family Awareness Program in Ilesha back in December 26 2017. I volunteered to work as a protocol officer during the event. While the event was going on, one very beautiful lady wearing a black gown entered into the church. I was lost in her sight as she walked from the door to the seat reserved by her friends. I couldn’t help but lose concentration for some seconds. I felt it in my that she is the right woman for me. I regained my focus and continued the service even though I had my other few seconds I use to stare at her throughout the service. When the service was over, I saw she was taking some pictures with her friends at the Red Carpet so I approached her to take a picture with her. I also took her number after the photo session. That was the Genesis of the Relationship.  
      
      I was in a complicated relationship when I met her and I was open to a new one so I knew quite well it was her turn. I was a guy who follows a lot of dating and relationship rule while growing up. On a normal day of meeting a new girl, I usually observe the “THREE DAY RULE” strategy but I had to break the rule when I met her. I knew what I wanted and I wasn’t ready to lose my chance at this. I contacted her after some minutes of meeting her. I had to start bonding as soon as possible. 
      
      We started talking and getting to know each other better. I was working in a hospital and was also undergoing some skill acquisition in Art, Graphics and Branding as at when I met her and she was working in a bank.  She was very welcoming and made it easy to be her friend. It was quite difficult to meet up or hangout together due to our conflicting schedules and the pressure of a bank job. I tried at certain times to arrange for a date but it all didn’t get to happen.
      
      I asked her out after some days telling her I want to build a life with her. I remember telling her I wasn’t just interested in dating her for records but I will love to marry her as at when due. She rejected my proposal on the reasons of being in another relationship. I understand her so I stopped pestering her regarding dating me. I focused on my work, business and life. I didn’t stop checking up on her once in a while even though my hope was dashed regarding being with her. Random times when I have business to do at her bank, I hit her up and get to see her and talk for some seconds before we both depart again.
      
      Days passed, Months passed and a year passed we were still good as friends. 
      Fast forward to April 2019, I was doing my Master’s program in Abeokuta and she was doing her HND program in Ede. I already ended the relationship with my ex and I was so much single. So we had some phone conversations and she told me she was having some relationship issues. I knew to myself that it was my time to finally help her get rid of the guy so I can finally take charge. This happened for some weeks until they finally parted way. I did shoot my shot again and my cupid arrow hit the right spot. She finally accepted to be my woman. I was in a Complicated relationship for years and was single for months . The whole dating scene appeared new and I wasn’t even sure about the right thing to do. We kept growing in love and affections. We had several voice conversations and all was going well. 
      
      Quality Time and Physical Touch are my love languages but I wasn’t experiencing them in my new relationship due to distance. Life isn't always a bed of roses, you know. I thought I could manage and make it workout but it was difficult. I couldn’t get to hold, touch, hug, walk with and play with my beloved. I felt single and I was already losing it. I wasn’t getting the vibe I expected so things started going awry. I channeled my energy on my studies and work so I paid little attention to my relationship. I love her so much to break up with her. I spoke to my friend Ayo Bello regarding this and he told me to just keep trying. It was so difficult for me and I did construct a breakup message so I can be free to find someone else and remain focused. I was looking at the message but I couldn’t send it to her because of the love I have for her. I saved the message in my draft hoping one day I will be strong enough to send it. I remember there was some three months that passed without a conversation from us. I thought we both lost our way and focus. After the three months, we both kept in touch and had some little boring conversations.
      
      Year 2020 started and we were still together though the relationship wasn’t going as planned. I remember traveling home for Christmas and decided not to checkup on her intentionally. She was mad about it and I apologized. 
      Pandamic Struck and she had to go back to Ilesha. I stayed in Abeokuta trying to find something worthy to do with my life. We both had time for ourselves and we started talking again. The feelings grew back and the bond became stronger. I felt happy again after some complicated months.
      
      After some months into the Pandemic, I was finally able to see my beloved. We spent time with each other and I enjoyed each moment we shared.  We became best friends and talk every single day. We even subscribed for a Closed User Group in order to talk better every time we choose to.
      
      
      Over the past two years has been fun, slightly less stressful, adventures together. We’ve bonded so well, Had several outings together and with friends, Movie Dates, Day out in the Park, Wedding trips with Family and random evening dates.  Each moment meant the whole world to me.
      
      On April 23, she travelled to Abeokuta to check up on me, I  had already planned a surprise proposal for her and she knew nothing about it. I took her out late in the evening. When we got back home, I got down on one knee and asked Florence to marry me. She quickly said YES! It was the easiest question she's answered. All thanks to Bimbo and co who helped in making the surprise awesome and lovely.
      
      So we started making wedding plans. I really can't wait for this next adventure with her. </p>
